## Udacity Android Nanodegree - Quiz App

### Project Overview 
The goal is to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of your choice. We want you to be creative about how you accomplish this. It’s up to you what the quiz questions will be about and how you want to present them to your user. 

### Description 

* App contains 4 - 10 questions, including at least one check box, one radio button, and one text entry

* Questions are in a variety of formats such as free text response, checkboxes, and radio buttons

* Checkboxes are only used for questions with multiple right answers.

* Radio buttons are only used for questions with a single right answer.

* App includes a button for the user to submit their answers and receive a score.

### Functionality

* The code runs without errors.

* Each question has a correct answer.

* Any question which uses radio buttons allows only one to be checked at once

* The app contains at least one if/else statement

* The grading button displays a toast which accurately displays the results of the quiz.



### What will I learn?
 This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

*  Planning your app design before coding.

* Taking an app layout from drawing to XML code.

* Creating, positioning, and styling views.

* Creating interactivity through button clicks and Java code.

* Commenting and documenting your code.
